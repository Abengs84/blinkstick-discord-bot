# Discord Voice Activity LED Controller

A Python-based Discord bot that controls LED indicators (via BlinkStick) based on voice activity in Discord channels. The bot specifically monitors voice activity and provides visual feedback through LED indicators, with a system tray interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Voice Activity Monitoring**: Detects when specific users are speaking in Discord voice channels
- **LED Integration**: Controls BlinkStick LED devices to provide visual feedback
  - Red LED indicates when the primary user (***REMOVED***) is speaking
  - Blue LED indicates when other users are speaking
  - Custom LED patterns for various events (startup, notifications, etc.)
- **System Tray Integration**: 
  - Runs quietly in the system tray
  - Easy access to status information and controls
  - Clean shutdown functionality
- **Status Window**:
  - Shows current connection status
  - Displays active server and channel information
  - Toggle for Debug Mode
- **Hotkey Support**: Global hotkey combination (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Ã–) for toggling between PTT and Voice Activity
- **Auto-startup**: Automatically starts with Windows
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically handles disconnections and hardware issues

## Technical Details

- Built with Discord.py and voice_recv extension for voice activity detection
